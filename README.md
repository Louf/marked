# Marked

A simple bookmarking tracking app that allows you to save, favorite, and sort bookmarks with a simple interface.

- Utilizes SwiftData to locally store all of the data securely on your device.
- Uses a data model wherein @Query is used to fetch data in each view.
  - Both data and UI are handled in the same file.
  - In a bigger project, it would be worthwhile switching to an MVVM model.
